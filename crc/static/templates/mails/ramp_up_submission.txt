Your Research Ramp-up Plan (RRP) has been submitted for review by {{ approver_1 }} {% if approver_2 %}and {{ approver_2 }} {% endif %}.  After completion of the review step you will receive email notification of its approval or if additional information and/or modifications are required, along with instructions on how to proceed. Return to the Research Ramp-up Plan application to proceed as instructed.

In the meantime, please make sure all required training has been completed and needed supplies secured.  You will be asked to confirm that both of these requirements have been met before reopening the research space approved in your RRP.

Additionally, if there are any unknown Area Monitors for the spaces listed in your RRP, please contact your approvers to determine either who they are or how you can find out.  Missing Area Monitors will need to be entered before proceeding as well.
